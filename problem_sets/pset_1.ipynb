    "# GridWorld\n",
    "GridWorld is a graphical environment that helps visualize the behavior of objects. It was used in the CS AP exams, but we will be taking it in another direction. [You can read more on the GridWorld website.](https://horstmann.com/gridworld/gridworld-manual.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "Clone [this repository]() and open the GridGames folder with VS Code. It should open as a Java project. If it does not, make sure you have the **Extension Pack for Java** installed. You might also have to first open a `.java` file, which can be found in the `projects` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `gridWorld` directory contains the base source code for GridWorld. **Do not edit any files in this directory!** It is purely for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be working in the `projects` directory. Browse through the existing projects. Also notice that in `.vscode/settings.json`, each project folder has been added. This is required in order to run the projects through VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run `BugRunner.java` in `firstProject`. A GUI (Graphical User Interface) should appear. Figure out what the `Step`, `Run`, and `Stop` buttons do. Try changing the slider as well from `Slow` to `Fast`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GridWorld Basics\n",
    "This section is pulled from the [CollegeBoard GridWorld Student Manual](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/apc/GridWorld_Case_Study_Student_Manual_with_Appendixes_Aug_2007_updated.pdf). Feel free to flip through this document!\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the following questions, looking at the source code in `gridWorld` as well as the classes in `boxBug` and `critters` will be very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What happens when the bug is at an edge of the grid?\n",
    "2. What happens when a bug has a rock in the location immediately in front of it?\n",
    "3. Does a flower move?\n",
    "4. What behavior(s) does a rock have?\n",
    "5. Can more than one Actor be in the same location in the grid at the same time?\n",
    "6. What does 0 degrees correspond to for `setDirection`? What about 180?\n",
    "7. What does the `turn` method do?\n",
    "8. Why is the `turn` method called _twice_ in the `BoxBug` class?\n",
    "9. Why can the `move` method be called in the `BoxBug` class even though it is not defined in the code? (_Hint:_ `extends`)\n",
    "10. What is the purpose of the `steps` property in `BoxBug`?\n",
    "11. What is the purpose of a `Runner` class?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Set #1: Fancy Bugs\n",
    "Create a project named `fancyBugs`. Be sure to add it to the source path as well so you can run the project via VS Code. The runner class should instantiate an **Unbounded** `ActorWorld` that spawns the following bugs. The bugs should behave as described.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `CircleBug` is identical to BoxBug but only `turn`s once instead of twice.\n",
    "2. `SpiralBug` drops flowers in a spiral pattern. _Hint:_ Adjust `sideLength` when it turns.\n",
    "3. `ZBug` moves in a Z pattern, starting in the top left corner. After completing one \"Z\", a `ZBug` should stop moving. If in any instance, it can't move, it will stop forever. `ZBug` should take the length of the \"Z\" as a parameter in the constructor.\n",
    "4. `RectangleBug` takes two parameters in its constructor: `l` and `w`; it should draw a rectangle with length `l` and width `w`.\n",
    "5. `RandomBug` moves and turns randomly with each step.\n",
    "6. `RainbowBug` does not move but changes color each time it acts; it rotates between red, orange, yellow, green, and blue.\n",
    "7. `PolygonBug` takes two parameters in its constructor: `n` and `s`; it should draw a regular `n`-gon that has sides of length `s`.\n"

    "# GridWorld\n",
    "GridWorld is a graphical environment that helps visualize the behavior of objects. It was used in the CS AP exams, but we will be taking it in another direction. [You can read more on the GridWorld website.](https://horstmann.com/gridworld/gridworld-manual.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "Clone [this repository]() and open the GridGames folder with VS Code. It should open as a Java project. If it does not, make sure you have the **Extension Pack for Java** installed. You might also have to first open a `.java` file, which can be found in the `projects` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `gridWorld` directory contains the base source code for GridWorld. **Do not edit any files in this directory!** It is purely for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be working in the `projects` directory. Browse through the existing projects. Also notice that in `.vscode/settings.json`, each project folder has been added. This is required in order to run the projects through VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run `BugRunner.java` in `firstProject`. A GUI (Graphical User Interface) should appear. Figure out what the `Step`, `Run`, and `Stop` buttons do. Try changing the slider as well from `Slow` to `Fast`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GridWorld Basics\n",
    "This section is pulled from the [CollegeBoard GridWorld Student Manual](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/apc/GridWorld_Case_Study_Student_Manual_with_Appendixes_Aug_2007_updated.pdf). Feel free to flip through this document!\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the following questions, looking at the source code in `gridWorld` as well as the classes in `boxBug` and `critters` will be very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What happens when the bug is at an edge of the grid?  \n",
    "It will turn until it is not longer facing the edge\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What happens when a bug has a rock in the location immediately in front of it?  \n",
    "Rather than turning 90 degrees as if it had hit the edge, it only turns 45 degrees to the right and continues past the rock\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Does a flower move?  \n",
    "A flower does not move\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What behavior(s) does a rock have?  \n",
    "The rock does nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Can more than one Actor be in the same location in the grid at the same time?  \n",
    "No, if an actor is placed in the same location as another, it will be deleted\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What does 0 degrees correspond to for `setDirection`? What about 180?  \n",
    "It represents the angle 0 degrees and 180 represents the angle 180 degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What does the `turn` method do?  \n",
    "It turns the bug 45 degrees in its current location\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is the `turn` method called _twice_ in the `BoxBug` class?  \n",
    "Since, by default, the bug is only set to turn 45 degrees when it hits a wall, it has to turn twice\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Why can the `move` method be called in the `BoxBug` class even though it is not defined in the code? (_Hint:_ `extends`)  \n",
    "Since BoxBug is an extension of Bug, it can call any of the methods within Bug without having to rewrite them\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the purpose of the `steps` property in `BoxBug`?  \n",
    "the purpose of the steps property is to make sure the box bug makes the box of the assigned side length\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the purpose of a `Runner` class?  \n",
    "The Runner classes create the different critters and instances for each of them and actually generate them\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Set #1: Fancy Bugs\n",
    "Create a project named `fancyBugs`. Be sure to add it to the source path as well so you can run the project via VS Code. The runner class should instantiate an **Unbounded** `ActorWorld` that spawns the following bugs. The bugs should behave as described.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `CircleBug` is identical to BoxBug but only `turn`s once instead of twice.\n",
    "2. `SpiralBug` drops flowers in a spiral pattern. _Hint:_ Adjust `sideLength` when it turns.\n",
    "3. `ZBug` moves in a Z pattern, starting in the top left corner. After completing one \"Z\", a `ZBug` should stop moving. If in any instance, it can't move, it will stop forever. `ZBug` should take the length of the \"Z\" as a parameter in the constructor.\n",
    "4. `RectangleBug` takes two parameters in its constructor: `l` and `w`; it should draw a rectangle with length `l` and width `w`.\n",
    "5. `RandomBug` moves and turns randomly with each step.\n",
    "6. `RainbowBug` does not move but changes color each time it acts; it rotates between red, orange, yellow, green, and blue.\n",
    "7. `PolygonBug` takes two parameters in its constructor: `n` and `s`; it should draw a regular `n`-gon that has sides of length `s`.\n"
